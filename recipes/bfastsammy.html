    The <strong>Mediterranean Breakfast Bagel</strong> is 
    something that I 
    freestyled in the kitchen when I was pinching pennies
    and was tired of eating the same thing over and over.
    Now to this day it is something I look forward to making
    often and remains a staple breakfast item in my household.
    Here are the <em>key ingredients</em> to making this happen.
